# Dokku Services

Applications should typically be stateless, but naturally applications will inevitably require access to some kind of database or file storage. A number of services can be launched on dokku for this purpose, and apps can link to those services.

- [MinIO (S3)](./51-minio.md)
- [PostgreSQL (RDMS)](./52-postgres.md)
- [MariaDB (RDMS)](./53-mariadb.md)
- [Neo4J (GraphDB)](./54-neo4j.md)
