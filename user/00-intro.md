# Introduction to User Guide

This section of the docs covers the user-side usage of the public dokku server. It assumes the user has been given access to a given dokku server by an administrator.

**NOTE**: This user guide assumes you're using a Unix style command-line, **on windows** you can do this through **git bash** or WSL. On Mac or Linux, your standard terminal should work fine.
